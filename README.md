Some Bioinformatic tools during my days in Prof Zhou's lab


Convert fastq file into fasta format.

Usage: fastq2fasta.py --fastq [Even if it is compressed, there is no problem.] and 1 second praying for success.

It would automatically generate an fasta file named by the very same name of your fastq file.

Simple, clean and stable(seemingly so).
